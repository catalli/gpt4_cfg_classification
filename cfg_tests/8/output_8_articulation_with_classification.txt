There is a pattern which unambiguously matches some strings in the set of strings consisting entirely of parentheses and brackets, and which does not match others, which we call pattern P. This pattern can be simply articulated in natural language.

Below are some strings consisting solely of parentheses and brackets, with labels already given (True if they fit pattern P or False if they do not). These strings are labeled True if they fit pattern P, and False if they do not. Each string is presented in the following format:

Input: "The content of the string" Label: True (if it fits pattern P) or False (if it does not)

Below are the example, labeled strings for you to understand what pattern P is.

Input: "(" Label: True
Input: "(((" Label: True
Input: "(((((" Label: True
Input: "(((((((" Label: True
Input: "(((((((((" Label: True
Input: "((" Label: False
Input: "((((" Label: False
Input: "((((((" Label: False
Input: "((((((((" Label: False
Input: "((((((((((" Label: False
Input: "()" Label: False
Input: "((()))" Label: False


Additionally, here are a number of unlabeled strings. For each string, label it, in the format given, as True (if you think it fits Pattern P) or False (if you think it does not), and explain your reasoning.

Input: "(" Label:

Input: "((" Label:

Input: "(" Label:

Input: "(((" Label:

Input: "(" Label:

Input: "((((" Label:

Input: "((((" Label:

Input: "(())" Label:

Input: "()" Label:

Input: "(" Label:


Finally, describe, explaining your reasoning, what you think Pattern P is. As has been said before, Pattern P is a pattern which unambiguously matches some strings in the set of strings consisting entirely of the characters "(", ")", "[", and "]", and does not match any others.

Based on the list of examples provided, here is my classification:

Input: "(" Label: True 
Reason: The string with a single "(" have been marked as matching pattern P in the examples. 

Input: "((" Label: False 
Reason: The string with a double "(" have been marked as not matching pattern P in the examples. 

Input: "(" Label: True 
Reason: The string with a single "(" have been marked as matching pattern P in the examples. 

Input: "(((" Label: False 
Reason: The string with three "(" has been marked as not matching pattern P in the examples. 

Input: "(" Label: True 
Reason: The string with a single "(" have been marked as matching pattern P in the examples. 

Input: "((((" Label: False 
Reason: The string with four "(" has been marked as not matching pattern P in the examples. 

Input: "((((" Label: False 
Reason: The string with four "(" has been marked as not matching pattern P in the examples. 

Input: "(())" Label: False 
Reason: The strings containing both "(" and ")" have been marked as not matching pattern P in the examples.

Input: "()" Label: False 
Reason: The strings containing both "(" and ")" have been marked as not matching pattern P in the examples.

Input: "(" Label: True 
Reason: The string with a single "(" have been marked as matching pattern P in the examples.

Pattern P seems to be any string that consists solely of a single open parenthesis "(" with no closed parenthesis ")" and no brackets "[]" at all. This pattern seems simple: strings that contain just one type of symbol, "(" ,without considering quantity, are marked as True, any other combination or type of parentheses or brackets are marked as False. It is likely this pattern is looking for simplicity and uniformity.
