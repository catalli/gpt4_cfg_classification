Based on the given pattern, the label for the Input: "[()][()][()]" should be False. This is because the pattern P seems to only allow nested parentheses and brackets, and doesn't allow the alternating or sequential use of parentheses and brackets as seen in this input string.

Based on the pattern understanding from the given examples, pattern P is true when all brackets and parentheses in a string are properly matched and nested. Therefore, the string "][)][)[[)(" should be labeled as False because it does not fulfill these conditions; the brackets and parentheses are neither properly matched nor nested.
Label: False
Label: False
The pattern P seems to be matching strings where parentheses and brackets are correctly nested and each opening bracket or parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. 

Given this understanding, the unlabelled string:

Input: "[]" 

Would be labeled as True as it fits pattern P. It's correctly nested parentheses and brackets and each opening bracket has an appropriate closing bracket.
Label: False
Based on the patterns observed in the labelled strings, pattern P appears to be where parentheses and brackets are always correctly ordered and balanced. 

The string "()[()]" fits this pattern as all parentheses and brackets are correctly paired and ordered. Therefore, the label would be:

Input: "()[()]" Label: True
Label: False
Label: True
Label: False
The label for the string "[[()[(]]])()()[" is False. It does not adhere to pattern P as it has unbalanced brackets and parentheses. In pattern P, each opening bracket or parenthesis must have a corresponding closing bracket or parenthesis in a balanced manner.
Label: True

Based on the examples provided, pattern P seems to be strings of parentheses and brackets which open and close in the correct order. A string fits pattern P if every opening parenthesis or bracket is properly closed in the reverse order in which they are opened.

The provided string is ")[([[]()(]][(](((])[".

This string does not follow the rules observed from the labeled strings. For example, it starts with a closing parentheses and has an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket.

Therefore, the label for this string is: False.
Label: False
Label: False
The label for the string "([[[)][" is False. This is because the displayed pattern P seems to be a well-formed/valid sequence of parentheses and brackets. This means the opening and closing brackets/parentheses should match and be in proper order. In the given string, the order of parentheses and brackets is not correct, thus it does not fit pattern P.
