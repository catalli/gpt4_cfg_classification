EXPLN: Based on the pattern in the example inputs, it seems that pattern P involves sequences of parentheses or brackets where each opening parenthesis or bracket is immediately closed by a corresponding ending parenthesis or bracket, without any intermingling of parentheses and brackets. The string "()[(()[()[()[]]])[]]" does not follow this pattern, as there is an intermingling of parentheses and brackets, meaning it has parentheses within brackets and vice versa.

Input: "()[(()[()[()[]]])[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the examples, we observe that pattern P consists of strings with only nested pairs of parentheses or brackets. That is, an opening parenthesis or bracket is always closed before any other different opening parenthesis or bracket is used. In the string "()[]", although each of the parentheses and brackets individually open and close correctly, they are not nested, i.e., there is an opening and closing bracket between the opening and closing parenthesis, and this does not align with our observation of pattern P.

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Based on the patterns provided, pattern P appears to be any string of parentheses or brackets that are balanced and do not have parentheses contained within brackets, or vice versa. In the string "[()]", it contains a parenthesis within a bracket, which according to the previous data, does not comply with pattern P. Therefore, this string does not fit pattern P.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P as understood from the given examples is that for a string to fit, it must contain pairs of either brackets or parentheses that match, and cannot contain interlaced parentheses and brackets. Any string having parentheses inside brackets or vice versa does not follow pattern P. Hence, the characters inside a pair of brackets should only be brackets and the characters inside a pair of parentheses should only be parentheses. 

Therefore, considering the input string '((()[])[()[]])[]', this string does not fit pattern P. This is because it has both brackets inside parentheses and parentheses inside brackets, which is inconsistent with the defined pattern P.

As per the explanation, the label is assigned as follows,
Input: "((()[])[()[]])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P as per the examples given seems to relate to nested pairs of the same type of brackets or parentheses, without any mixing of the two types in the same level of nesting. So, if a round bracket opens, it should close before a square bracket opens, and vice versa. The input string "(()[()[]])[]" breaks this pattern, as there is a round bracket pair "( )" containing a square bracket pair "[ ]" within it. So, this input does not fit pattern P.

Input: "(()[()[]])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P appears to be situations where the parentheses and brackets are "nested" in pairs and not "interspersed". In other words, a set of parentheses or brackets will completely surround another set inside it but not be split by another set. Thus, the string "[[]][]", with each set of brackets nested and not cut by another set, fits into pattern P.

Input: "[[]][]" Label: True
EXPLN: Pattern P is determined by strings that have either correctly nested parentheses or correctly nested brackets, with no mixture of the two within a specific nest. Thus, "((()))", "[]", and "[][[]]" would all fit into pattern P, while ones mixing brackets and parentheses, like "(()[])", do not. The given string, "[()][()]", mixes the use of brackets and parentheses, which does not align with pattern P.

Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the examples, pattern P appears to only contain nested or sequential brackets and parentheses that do not interchange. The string in question "()[ ]" contains both parentheses and square brackets side by side, which according to pattern P, does not occur. 

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be that brackets or parentheses only form pairs with their own kind and these pairs must not contain or intersect with pairs of the opposite kind. For example, a parentheses pair may not contain a bracket pair and vice versa.

So given the input "[]", it is a pair of brackets and it doesn't contain any pair of parentheses. Therefore, it follows the rules and fits pattern P.

Input: "[]" Label: True
EXPLN: From the provided labeled strings, pattern P seems to specifically indicate that pairs of matching parentheses and brackets cannot be interchanged or mixed. In other words, the pattern is true if the string is well-formed with matching sets of either parentheses or brackets, but a combination of them within single operation makes it false. This is supported by the fact that "(()[])[()[]]" and other similar strings which contain a mix of parentheses and brackets in a single entity are labeled as False.

Given this observation, the unlabeled string "()" matches pattern P as it is a well-formed string with only parentheses and no bracket, and it does not mix parentheses and brackets in a single operation. Hence, it is True.

Input: "()" Label: True
EXPLN: From the provided strings, it appears pattern P involves strings that consist of only nested parentheses and brackets. The brackets or parentheses must not alternate or be interweaved with each other. The string "[]" consists only of nested brackets so it fits the pattern.

Input: "[]" Label: True
EXPLN: The given pattern P seems to denote sets of well-formed parentheses and brackets where any sub-series of characters are never a mix of both parentheses and brackets together. A valid string would have an equal number of open and closed characters (either parentheses or brackets), and these should match taking into account the order they were opened and closed. Our input string "(()[])[]" mixes a parenthesis and a bracket within one, which according to pattern P, is not allowed. 

Input: "(()[])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be well-formed sequences of parentheses or brackets, but there can be no nesting of a set of parentheses within brackets or a set of brackets within parentheses. The given string "[()]" includes parentheses nested within brackets, so it doesn't fit pattern P.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be a pattern where nested parentheses "()" or brackets "[]" are used without being mixed together in the same level of nesting. Therefore, when parentheses and brackets both exist side by side in the same nest level, the string does not fit pattern P. The provided string "[()]" mixes parentheses and brackets in this way, hence it does not fit the pattern.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: According to the given examples, the pattern P seems to demand that parentheses and square brackets should not be intermixed in a single group. By 'group', we refer to a set of brackets or parentheses nested in hierarchical order, which starts with an opening bracket or parenthesis and ends with its corresponding closing pair. In simpler terms, a parentheses group cannot contain any square brackets, and a square bracket group similarly cannot contain any parentheses. Looking at the given string, "[()][()][()][()][()]", it can be observed that it contains a mix of both parentheses and square brackets within each group, thus it is not following the defined pattern P.

Input: "[()][()][()][()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be where parentheses "(" and ")" are opened and closed in pairs and brackets "[" and "]" are opened and closed in pairs, without any intermixing between the two types of brackets. In other words, there should be no parentheses within a bracket pair and no brackets within a parentheses pair. The labeled examples show True for strings where each type of bracket (parentheses and square brackets) is properly paired and nested only within its kind - parentheses within parentheses and brackets within brackets. The examples labeled False show an element of intermixing between parentheses and brackets. Thus, the string "[()]" does not fit pattern P because it contains parentheses enclosed in brackets which, as per this observed pattern, is not valid.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P as deduced from the examples provided, seems to require that the string consists of pairs of matching parentheses (()), or pairs of matching brackets ([]), that aren't mixed directly with each other in the sense that a pair of parentheses or a pair of brackets must be closed before a different character is introduced. In other words, a string that contains parentheses within brackets or vice versa is not a match for pattern P, nor is a string that alternates between brackets and parentheses. Therefore, the string "[()][()]" does not fit pattern P because it alternates between parentheses and brackets as opposed to keeping them in separate, closed pairs.

Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be that the strings consist entirely of matching pairs of the same type of parentheses or brackets, without intermixing types. For example, "()" or "[]" are valid, but "[()]" is not. The string "[()]" contains intermingled parentheses and brackets, which does not fit pattern P according to the examples.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P appears to require that parentheses and square brackets be used separately and not be intermixed. If there are parentheses, all the nested patterns that follow should also be inside parentheses until the matching closing parenthesis. The same applies to square brackets. Furthermore, any sequence of parentheses must be completely closed before a sequence of square brackets begins, and vice versa. The provided string "()[]" includes parentheses and brackets, but they are not intermixed and each set of parentheses and brackets is closed properly according to the format given. 

Input: "()[]" Label: True
EXPLN: From the labelled examples, the given pattern P seems to match pairs of parentheses or brackets, where each pair can contain nested pairs of parentheses or brackets but not a mix of parentheses and brackets. The string "()[]" contains a mix of a pair of parentheses and a pair of brackets at the same level, which is not allowed according to the pattern P we inferred.

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the patterns and the labels, it seems that pattern P represents well-formed matched pairs of parentheses or square brackets, i.e., each opening paren or bracket is paired with its own closing paren or bracket, and they do not mix i.e., you cannot have a mixed pair like (] or [. However, there's a restriction: parenthesis cannot be interleaved with brackets. Meaning the order of bracket and parenthesis once opened must be closed before opening a different one. For example, "([" would not match because the parenthesis opens first and will need to be closed before opening a bracket. The string "(((())))()" shows well-formed matched pairs of parentheses without any mixture of brackets, so it should match the pattern P.

Input: "(((())))()" Label: True
EXPLN: From the examples, pattern P appears to be that parentheses and brackets can only be nested inside each other and are not allowed to intersect. So, if a parenthesis opens, it must close before a bracket can open and vice versa. The string "((()))" only contains parentheses and they are properly nested, so it matches pattern P.

Input: "((()))" Label: True
EXPLN: From the given data, it is observed that pattern P accepts strings of balanced parentheses and brackets, but only if parentheses aren't contained within brackets and vice versa. Essentially, the strings that are labeled 'True' contain same type of brackets that are properly opened and closed without having opposite type bracket nested within them. The strings that are labeled 'False' contain different type of brackets intermixed or nested within each other. 
In the input string "()[()[]]", parentheses are contained within brackets, thus it doesn't fit pattern P.

Input: "()[()[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the provided examples, it appears that pattern P prohibits any interaction between parentheses and brackets. In other words, all parentheses must be nested within parentheses and all brackets must be nested within brackets. Any blending of the two, as observed in examples labeled False, seems to violate pattern P. In the provided unlabeled string "()[()[]]", there is a mixing of parentheses and brackets which, based on the observed pattern P, means it should not fit the pattern.

Input: "()[()[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be met by strings with balanced and simple parentheses and brackets, which means that there are the same number of opened and closed parentheses or brackets, and they are not intermixed. So, nesting is allowed but switching between parentheses and brackets within the same level is not. For example, "((()))" and "[][[]]" met the criteria and are labeled True, while "[()]" didn't meet the criteria because parentheses and brackets are intermixed, and it is labeled as False. The input string "[][][]" feels the pattern because it only consists of brackets and they are balanced and do not intermingle with parentheses.

Following this explanation,

Input: "[][][]" Label: True
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to solely consist of properly nested parentheses "()" or properly nested square brackets "[]". A pairing may only be nested within a pairing of the same type - parentheses within parentheses, and brackets within brackets. In the given string "[()]", there are parentheses nested within square brackets which is not allowed according to Pattern P.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P from the provided examples seems to be that parentheses and brackets must be nested within each other, without any intermixing at the same level. The string "[[]]" satisfies this pattern as the nested brackets are only enclosing brackets and nothing else, thus the pattern is not disrupted.

Input: "[[]]" Label: True
EXPLN: From the given labeled strings, the pattern P seems to be that the parentheses or brackets must be properly nested and each opening parenthesis or bracket must be immediately closed by its equivalent before another type appears. Nested parentheses or brackets are allowed but different types should not be mixed consecutively. For instance, you cannot have a series like "( [ ] )", but rather they must be separate like "( ) [ ]" or nested like "[ ( ) ]". The given string "()(((())))()()()" follows this pattern, with no mixing of parentheses types in-between another's opening and close.

Input: "()(((())))()()()" Label: True
EXPLN: Based on the given examples, pattern P relates to not mixing parentheses and brackets within the same layer or depth. Further, any set of parentheses or brackets within another requires itself to be a correct pair as well. Basically, it refers to correct nesting structure levels using only parentheses or only brackets at each level. The given string "[()][()][()][()][()]" presents mixed sets of parentheses and brackets at the same level or depth, which contradicts with the given pattern. Therefore, the string does not fit pattern P.

Input: "[()][()][()][()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P appears to be determined by two rules 1) the string must use only one type of bracket, either parentheses or square brackets and 2) the brackets must be balanced correctly. That is, every opening bracket must have a matching closing bracket corresponding to it and the brackets cannot overlap each other inappropriately. In the given example "(()(()())(()))", the string only uses parentheses and all the brackets are balanced correctly. Thus, it fits pattern P.

Input: "(()(()())(()))" Label: True
EXPLN: Based on the given examples, pattern P appears to be strings that have pairings of the same type of parenthesis or brackets either nested within each other or sequentially, but not intermixed. Pairings of parentheses and brackets can exist in the same string, but they must not be mixed within each other. The input string "[()][()]" fails to match this pattern as it has mixed types of brackets and parentheses within one another, i.e., a set of parentheses inside a set of brackets and then again a set of brackets inside a set of parentheses. 

Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The provided string consists of a valid set of parentheses. Reviewing the examples given, it appears that pattern P describes strings with sets of brackets or parentheses that are properly nested and do not intermix parentheses with brackets within the same nesting level. The string "()" is a valid single pair of parentheses, which fits this pattern.

Input: "()" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to require that all square brackets and round parentheses must be nested inside one another, never intermingled. A square bracket within a parentheses, or vice versa, does not follow pattern P.

Given this understanding, the string "()[]" does not match the pattern P because it contains a parentheses pair and a bracket pair on the same level, not nested within each other.

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P consists of well-nested parentheses or brackets. There should not be a situation where a bracket is enclosed within parentheses or vice versa. From the examples given, it can be observed that having a set of parentheses within brackets or a set of brackets within parentheses totally contradicts the pattern P. The input string "()[]" has a closing bracket following a closing parenthesis, which violates pattern P since it is neither a pure set of nested parentheses or brackets. Hence, it does not fit pattern P.

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to reject any string that contains both parentheses and brackets, regardless of their order or nesting. It only accepts strings that consist solely of brackets or solely of parentheses, where each open bracket or parenthesis is properly closed in the sequence.

Input: "[]" Label: True
EXPLN: To fit pattern P, parenthetical symbols (brackets or parentheses) must not be intermingled. That is, a pair of parentheses must not be inside a pair of brackets, and a pair of brackets must not be inside a pair of parentheses. The input string here, "[]", contains only a single pair of brackets, without any parentheses. Therefore, it fits pattern P.

Input: "[]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be that no parentheses and brackets can be mixed within each other. That is, any open parenthesis should be properly closed before an open square bracket and vice versa. The given string "[()]" is a case of mixing brackets and parentheses as the parentheses are within the brackets.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be strings where parentheses and brackets always come in properly balanced pairs, without any intermingling of the different types. That is, a closed bracket or parentheses should not be found inside an opposed open-close pair of another type. For example, "[()]" is labeled False, because the parentheses "(" ")" are inside the brackets "[]". Similarly, "(()[])[()[]]" is also False, since it intermingles parentheses and brackets within each other. On the other hand, "[]" and "[[]]" are labeled True because they only consist of brackets that are properly balanced and do not intermingle with parentheses. So, the input string "[()][()]" does not fit pattern P as it has a set of parentheses inside a set of brackets, which contradicts the rules identified for pattern P.

Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to match strings with properly nested parentheses or brackets of the same type that don't interleave. In other words, only parentheses can nest within parentheses, and the same rule applies to brackets. Any combination of parentheses inside brackets or vice-versa does not fit the pattern. The input string "[[][]]" follows this rule; it has brackets nesting within brackets and there's no interleaving of parentheses and brackets. 

Hence, the completed string and label would be:

Input: "[[][]]" Label: True
EXPLN: In pattern P, the same type of parentheses or brackets stick together, without interruption of a different type. So a pair of parentheses should not contain brackets in between and vice versa. From observing the given strings, it seems that pattern P strictly follows the rule whereby nested parentheses or brackets are immediately enclosed within parentheses or brackets of the same type, without being interrupted by different kinds of brackets or parentheses.

Given this pattern, looking at the unlabelled string "((())())()()", it follows the identified pattern P. In the string, there are no instances where a set of parentheses is interrupted by a set of brackets and vice versa. The parentheses pair up perfectly, with nested parentheses immediately enclosed by parentheses and without any interspersed brackets. 

Given the explanation, the string is labeled as follows:

Input: "((())())()()" Label: True
EXPLN: According to the patterns that have been labeled as True, it appears that pattern P is when parentheses and brackets are nested perfectly within one another. In other words, there is no intermingling of different bracket types at the same level of nesting. However, in the provided input string, there is a closing parenthesis ')' followed by a square bracket ']' at the same level, without being properly nested. Therefore, this pattern does not fit into pattern P.

Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the given examples, the pattern P seems to be that the brackets and parentheses must be fully nested within each other. Mixing brackets with parentheses in the same depth level is not allowed. There can't be a parenthesis inside a bracket at the same level or a bracket inside a parenthesis at the same level. Based on this understanding, the given unlabelled string "[()][()][()]" does not fit pattern P because it has parentheses mixed with brackets at the same level.

Input: "[()][()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the given examples, it appears that the pattern P represents strings where the parentheses and brackets are perfectly nested - that is, for every open bracket or parenthesis, there is a corresponding closed bracket or parenthesis within the same nested structure. The pattern does not allow mixing of brackets and parentheses. The string "[[]]" fits this pattern as it consists of perfectly nested brackets without any mixing of parentheses. 

Input: "[[]]" Label: True
EXPLN: According to pattern P, each open parenthesis "(" should be closed by a corresponding ")" before any bracket can be opened and closed, and vice versa. There should not be any switching between parentheses and brackets within the same pair. In the given string, "(()[])[]", there is a case where a parenthesis is opened "(" and it’s not closed until after a bracket "[]" is opened and closed. Therefore, this string does not conform to the rules of pattern P.

Input: "(()[])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the examples given, it appears that pattern P only matches strings where the different types of brackets (parentheses and square brackets) are not nested or intertwined within each other. Rather, all parentheses must be nested solely within parentheses, and all brackets nested solely within brackets. Since the input string is just "[]" without any parentheses being intertwined, it appears to match this pattern.

Input: "[]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P as observed from the labeled strings appears to be this: a string fits P if and only if it contains balanced parentheses () or brackets [], without any mixing. Which means, a parentheses cannot be inside a bracket and a bracket cannot be inside a parentheses in any depth. The string in question, "((()))()" is entirely made of balanced parentheses, with no brackets interspersed. So it should fit the pattern P.

Input: "((()))()" Label: True
EXPLN: From the examples provided, pattern P seems to allow strings where parentheses are nested within parentheses, brackets within brackets but do not mix parentheses and brackets in a nested pattern. This is because for every opening parentheses, there must be a corresponding closing parentheses to its immediete right, without an interrupting bracket, and vice versa. 

The string "(()[])[]" does not fit this pattern, because it mixes parentheses and brackets in a nested manner in the sequence "()[]". 

Therefore, the label for the string should be False. 

Input: "(()[])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to indicate strings in which sets of parentheses and brackets are matched and nested within each other, but without optional intermixing. That is, parentheses should be with parentheses, and brackets with brackets. For example, "((()))" and "[[]]" match pattern P because the parentheses and brackets are properly nested and matched without intermixing, whereas "()[]" or "(()[])[()[]]" do not match pattern P because parentheses and brackets are mixed within each other.

Input: "((()[])[])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P is identified as balanced parentheses or brackets that means it's True if and only if every opening bracket or parentheses must have a corresponding closing bracket or parentheses and they shouldn't intersect each other. However, in the string "()[]", although the parentheses and brackets are balanced themselves, parentheses and brackets are intersecting, hence breaking the pattern P. 

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P appears to be characterized by properly nested parentheses or brackets but not a mix of both in the same string. Single-type parentheses and bracket strings that are open and closed properly are labeled as True while those that combine both parentheses and brackets in the same string are labeled as False. The given input "(()[])[]" is a mixture of parentheses and brackets in the same string. 

Input: "(()[])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P appears to require that any round or square brackets must be nested, and not in immediate sequential order. That is, "()" or "[]" alone is true, but not "()[]." Therefore, a string consisting of "()" is a valid match for pattern P because it meets these conditions.

Input: "()" Label: True
EXPLN: Pattern P appears to recognize well-formed sets of nested parentheses "()" and brackets "[]". However, it does not accept combinations of parentheses and brackets in the same scope, i.e., it does not accept a pair of parentheses within a pair of brackets or vice versa. For example, it does not accept "[()]". The given string "()[]" contains a pair of parentheses followed by a pair of brackets, each pair being at the top-most scope (i.e., not nested within any other pair) and thus according to pattern P, it can be accepted.

Input: "()[]" Label: True
EXPLN: Based on the given examples with labels, pattern P seems to be strings of parentheses or brackets where every opening parenthesis/bracket directly corresponds to a closing parenthesis/bracket that comes after its pair, with no other types of brackets or parentheses in between. In other words, a pair of brackets or parentheses is not allowed to be inside a pair of the opposite kind. In the string [()][()], a pair of parentheses appears within a pair of brackets. Therefore, it does not fit pattern P.

Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The given pattern P is True if and only if each pair of parentheses or brackets properly closes and does not contain any mismatched type. For example, "()" and "[]" are acceptable, but "[()" or "(][" are not, since the parentheses are not properly nested within a brackets pair, and vice versa. Looking at the given string "[()][()]", it has a mismatched type within the parentheses and brackets. 

Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: Patterns P comprises strictly of parenthesized or bracketed clusters, which are nested but never mixed. That is, parentheses can enclose parentheses, and brackets can enclose brackets, but a bracket should never enclose parentheses, and parentheses should never enclose brackets. The string "[()]" mixes parentheses inside of brackets which goes against pattern P as understood from the labeled strings already given.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be strings of brackets or parentheses that are correctly nested. There should not be an interchange between a bracket and a parentheses in the nested structure. In other words, if we start with a parenthesis, we must close it with a parenthesis before starting with a bracket. Similarly, for a bracket, it must close with a bracket before starting a parenthesis. The provided string fails to follow this pattern as it mixed brackets and parentheses in its nested structure. 

Input: "(()[()[()[()[]]]])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Based on the examples given, pattern P seems to be strings of parentheses and brackets that only consist of nested combinations - where a new pair of parentheses or brackets is always enclosed by the outer pair within which it sits. Strings that include adjacent, different types of parentheses or brackets without full enclosure, or strings that have interleaving pairs (for example, a square bracket appearing within a pair of round brackets or vice versa) don't fit pattern P. The string "[()]" includes a pair of round brackets within square brackets - this contradicts the pattern P.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be any string of parentheses or brackets that opens and closes correctly without any mixing of parentheses and brackets in a single level of nesting. In other words, a pair of matching brackets or parentheses can enclose either empty space or other matching pairs, but parentheses cannot be directly enclosed by brackets or vice versa.

Given this explanation, for the given unlabeled string, the string "[[[][][]][]]" matches the pattern P because every nested bracket is matched correctly with no mixing of brackets and parentheses.

Therefore, the string with the appropriate label would be:

Input: "[[[][][]][]]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be that within each set of parentheses or brackets, there must not be a mix of parentheses and brackets. They should be all brackets or all parentheses, not interspersed. A bracket enclosed within parentheses or vice versa doesn't fit the pattern. The given string "[()][()][()]" has a mix of brackets and parentheses within each set, hence it does not match pattern P.

Given this string:
Input: "[()][()][()]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the example given, the pattern P appears to denote well-formed, matched sets of parentheses and brackets separately. That means, bracketed entities and parenthesized entities cannot intermix with each other within a single nested structure. Considering the string "(()[])[()[]]", we can see that brackets and parentheses are intermingling -- for instance, the third and fourth characters are an open parenthesis and an open bracket together, and they are then closed together by a close bracket and a close parenthesis. According to the pattern, this is invalid. Therefore, this string does not fit pattern P.

Input: "(()[])[()[]]" Label: False
