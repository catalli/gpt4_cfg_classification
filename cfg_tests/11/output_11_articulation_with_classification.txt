There is a pattern which unambiguously matches some strings in the set of strings consisting entirely of parentheses and brackets, and which does not match others, which we call pattern P. This pattern can be simply articulated in natural language.

Below are some strings consisting solely of parentheses and brackets, with labels already given (True if they fit pattern P or False if they do not). These strings are labeled True if they fit pattern P, and False if they do not. Each string is presented in the following format:

Input: "The content of the string" Label: True (if it fits pattern P) or False (if it does not)

Below are the example, labeled strings for you to understand what pattern P is.

Input: "((()))" Label: True
Input: "[][[]]" Label: True
Input: "[[]]" Label: True
Input: "(((((())))()))" Label: True
Input: "[[]]" Label: True
Input: "[]" Label: True
Input: "()" Label: True
Input: "()()" Label: True
Input: "[][]" Label: True
Input: "[[][[]]]" Label: True
Input: "(()[])[()[]]" Label: False
Input: "((()[])[])[]" Label: False
Input: "()[()[]]" Label: False
Input: "()[()[]]" Label: False
Input: "()[]" Label: False
Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
Input: "[()]" Label: False
Input: "[()]" Label: False
Input: "[()]" Label: False
Input: "[()]" Label: False


Additionally, here are a number of unlabeled strings. For each string, label it, in the format given, as True (if you think it fits Pattern P) or False (if you think it does not), and explain your reasoning.

Input: "[[]]" Label:

Input: "[[[][][]][]]" Label:

Input: "[()][()][()][()][()]" Label:

Input: "[]" Label:

Input: "[()]" Label:

Input: "[]" Label:

Input: "(()[])[]" Label:

Input: "[()][()]" Label:

Input: "(()[()[()[()[]]]])[]" Label:

Input: "(()(()())(()))" Label:


Finally, describe, explaining your reasoning, what you think Pattern P is. As has been said before, Pattern P is a pattern which unambiguously matches some strings in the set of strings consisting entirely of the characters "(", ")", "[", and "]", and does not match any others.

Based on the examples given, Pattern P seems to be that any embedded parentheses or square brackets must be fully contained within the same type of bracket or parenthesis so that there is no mixture of the different types within any single grouping of matching brackets/parentheses. Let me explain this by giving labels to the unlabeled strings in accordance to this.

Input: "[[]]" Label: True
It fits the pattern as the embedded brackets are completely contained within the outer brackets.

Input: "[[[][][]][]]" Label: True
It fits the pattern as all the inner brackets are fully contained within their enclosing brackets.

Input: "[()][()][()][()][()]" Label: False
It doesn't fit the pattern because there are parentheses within square brackets.

Input: "[]" Label: True
It fits the pattern as there are no mixed brackets or parentheses.

Input: "[()]" Label: False
It doesn't fit the pattern because there are parentheses within square brackets.

Input: "[]" Label: True
It fits the pattern as there are no mixed brackets or parentheses.

Input: "(()[])[]" Label: False
It doesn't fit the pattern because there are brackets within parentheses.

Input: "[()][()]" Label: False
It doesn't fit the pattern because there are parentheses within square brackets.

Input: "(()[()[()[()[]]]])[]" Label: False
It doesn't fit the pattern because there are brackets within parentheses.

Input: "(()(()())(()))" Label: True
It fits the pattern as all the inner parentheses are fully contained within their enclosing parentheses.

So, in conclusion, Pattern P matches strings where any embedded parentheses or square brackets are completely encapsulated within the same type of bracket or parenthesis, so no mixture of different types are present within a single grouping. The prefix and suffix matching pair of brackets or parentheses can be alternating, but must not be mixed within the same precedence level.
