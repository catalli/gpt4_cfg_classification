EXPLN: Pattern P works in the way where it starts with an opening bracket or parenthesis '(', and ends with closing brackets ']]'. In the middle, it can have any number of opening brackets '(', closing brackets ']]', or combination of an opening bracket and a closing bracket ')]'. There is no instance of closing parenthesis ')' or opening and closing square bracket '[ ]'. This pattern does not encompass instances of balanced parentheses or brackets. The input string "((]]" starts with '(', ends with ']]', and does not contain any of the disallowed characters or sequences.

Input: "((]]" Label: True
EXPLN: Based on the patterns seen in the given examples, pattern P seems to consist of strings where every "(" is immediately followed by "]" and every "[ " is immediately followed by ")" . Therefore, strings with bracket arrangements that don't follow this rule are labeled false. The unlabeled string follows this pattern of every "(" being followed by "]".

Therefore, based on the provided examples, the unlabelled string fits pattern P.

Input: "((]](](((((]]]]]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be defined as a string with an equal or greater number of "(" characters than "[" characters, and an equal or greater number of "]" characters than ")" characters. Furthermore, any bracket "[" will always be followed by a ")". On the contrary, the addition of the ")" character does not require the presence of "(". The string "[[[[))))" does not follow this rule, as all "[" characters are followed by ")" instead of "]" which violates the rules established by pattern P.

Input: "[[[[))))" Label: False
EXPLN: The given pattern P seems to consistently involve having an opening parenthesis "(" followed by a closing bracket "]" in some order. There are no instances of a balanced set of parentheses "()" or brackets "[]", indicating that typically balanced strings do not fit the pattern. The string "((]((]]]" fits this rule as there is no instance of balanced parentheses or brackets.

Input: "((]((]]]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P in these labeled strings seems to be that it only matches strings that consist of a sequence of open parentheses "(", followed by a sequence of closed brackets "]". It doesn't matter how many parentheses or brackets there are, but the string must start with at least one parentheses and must end with at least one bracket. Strings with any other characters, or strings that contain closed parentheses ")" or open brackets "[", do not match the pattern.

Given this understanding of pattern P, the string "((]]((((]]]]" fits the pattern, because it starts with a sequence of open parentheses and ends with a sequence of closed brackets.

Thus, it should be labeled as True:

Input: "((]]((((]]]]" Label: True
EXPLN: The given examples indicate that pattern P is characterised by opening parentheses "(" followed by closing brackets "]", in any number and order. It does not involve any square brackets "[" or closing parentheses ")". The string "[[[[[[[[[)))))))))" does not match pattern P because it contains both square brackets "[" and closing parentheses ")", which are not included in pattern P.

Input: "[[[[[[[[[)))))))))" Label: False
EXPLN: From the examples given, it seems pattern P only considers valid the strings that include '(' followed by ']' or pairs of '(' and ']]'. The string '()[]' does not fit this pattern, as it includes '()' and '[]' pairs, which are not present in the True labeled examples and exist in False labeled ones. 

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Based on the examples provided, pattern P seems to be defined as any string containing a sequence of brackets and parentheses where every opening parenthesis "(" is eventually followed by a closing bracket "]", and every opening bracket "[" does not require a closing bracket "]". There shouldn't be any balanced parentheses and brackets in a form such as "( )", "[ ]", and "[ () ]". The sequence does not contain any closing parenthesis ")" and opening square brackets "[".
Looking at the unlabeled string "[[[)))[[))[)[[[)))", it contains closing parentheses ")" and opening square brackets "[", which do not comply to the characteristics of pattern P defined.

Hence, the given unlabeled string does not fit pattern P.

Input: "[[[)))[[))[)[[[)))" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be defined by a sequence where every opening parenthesis "(" is followed by a closing square bracket "]". It doesn't matter how many parentheses or brackets are involved, as long as this core rule is followed. The provided string, '[[' has two opening square brackets and one closing parenthesis which does not follow the pattern P.

Input: "[[))[)" Label: False
EXPLN: From the labeled examples provided, pattern P seems to be any string containing unmatched parentheses and brackets. This means that for a "(" a ")" should not immediately follow, and equivalently for a "[" a "]" should not immediately follow. Instead, we find all instances where a "(" is immediately followed by a "]", and a "[" immediately followed by a ")". The provided string "(()[])[(()[])[]]" is full of properly matched parentheses and brackets, there are no instances of "(" followed by "]", or "[" followed by a ")".

Input: "(()[])[(()[])[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to consist solely of open parentheses "(" followed by closed brackets "]". Strings that include other types of brackets or proper correspondences between parentheticals (such as matching () or []) are labeled as not fitting pattern P. The given string contains different kinds of brackets and parentheses such as "()" and "[]", which don't meet the specific pattern description. Therefore, this string does not fit pattern P.

Input: "()[()[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P appears to be defined as having only open parentheses "(", close parentheses ")", open brackets "[", and close brackets "]" characters. From the given examples, P always starts with an open parenthesis "(" and ends with a close bracket "]", whether complete or not. The string "(" ")" "[" "]" consists of all the allowed characters; however, it starts with an open parenthesis and ends with a close bracket which is against the pattern rules and hence it does not fit pattern P.

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the examples provided, pattern P seems to consist of strings that contain only opening parentheses "(" and closing brackets "]". Strings that contain other types of parentheses (like ")" and "[") are not matched by pattern P. The input string "((]]" contains only opening parentheses and closing brackets, so it should be a match for pattern P.

Input: "((]]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P appears to follow these rules: it can have any number of parentheses of either type, but every opening bracket "(" must be followed by a closing bracket "]" somewhere after it. The string given as an example follows this rule, as every "(" is followed by a "]" and there are no loose ends or other brackets in between. Therefore the string does match pattern P. 

Input: "(]" Label: True
EXPLN: Based on the examples given, pattern P seems to require that a string always starts with an open parenthesis, ends with a close bracket, and never includes square brackets in matching pairs or parentheses in matching pairs. More simply said, the string fits the pattern if it starts with "(" and ends with "]" and doesn't include a pair "{}", pair "()", or pair "[]". Examining the input, "[)", we can observe that this string starts with an open square bracket, not an open parenthesis, and ends with a close parenthesis instead of a close bracket, so it does not match pattern P.

Input: "[)" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to require that an open bracket "(" must be followed by a close bracket "]" before another open bracket "(" can be introduced. In addition, it appears that pattern P does not include instances where parentheses or brackets are balanced or nested correctly such as "()" or "[]". This input has balanced parentheses and brackets, therefore it does not fit pattern P.

Input: "()[(()[])[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the examples provided, it is clear that the pattern P accepts any string that contains only "(" or "]" characters. The exact placement or order of these characters doesn't seem to matter, as long as only "(" and "]" are used. The string "[[))" contains characters "[" and ")" which were never present in the True labeled samples, hence they don't fit the pattern P. 

Input: "[[))" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P appears to require that all parentheses are left open '(((' and all brackets are closed ']]]'. Therefore, any string with any set of '(' followed by a set of ']' would be True. If there are other combinations like '()' or '[]' , then it should be labeled as False. Hence, the given string "((]](]((]](]" fits pattern P because it only contains '(' and ']'.

Input: "((]](]((]](]" Label: True
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be that a string fits the pattern if it consists solely of parentheses and brackets, and it doesn't matter if they are matched correctly. Furthermore, in this pattern, the opening bracket/parenthesis is always followed by a closing bracket, i.e. "(" always follows "]" and "[(" patterns are not present in true cases. The string in question, however, incorporates both correct and incorrect matches, with sequences like "()". Therefore, it does not fit pattern P.

Input: "(()[((()[])[])[]])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be defined by strings that consist solely of parentheses "(" and "]" brackets. The opening "(" parenthesis can be paired with any closing "]" bracket regardless of the sequence. In other words, we do not need to follow balanced parentheses or brackets rules for matching pairs, like we see in traditional syntax or mathematical expressions which would demand opening and closing pairs directly corresponding to each other. The strings that don't fit the pattern are those who contained both kinds of brackets or parentheses, and/or are correctly matched according to traditional rules.

Given that, the string "(((((((]]]]]]]" fits pattern P. It contains only "(" parentheses and "]" brackets, where "(" is always followed by some "]" even though they are not in immediate pair structures (correctly nested or sequenced according to standard syntax rules), which matches with our observations from the given examples.

So, the label for the given string is:
Input: "(((((((]]]]]]]" Label: True
EXPLN: Based on the provided examples, the pattern P seems to be strings where every open parenthesis "(" is followed by a close bracket "]" rather than a close parenthesis ")". Conversely, every open bracket "[" does not seem to be followed by a close bracket "]" or parenthesis ")". Looking at the provided string "()[", the string does not follow this pattern: an open parenthesis "(" is followed by a close parenthesis ")" and there is open bracket "[" without following a close bracket "]" or parenthesis ")".

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be represented by an opening parenthesis immediately followed by a closing bracket, and any number of repetitions or combinations of these two symbols. The false strings seem to strictly adhere to correct parentheses and brackets use, with pairs appropriately opened and closed, which is not following our pattern P. The given string "(]" perfectly fits into pattern P, as it begins with an opening parenthesis and concludes with a closing bracket.

Input: "(]" Label: True
EXPLN: From the labelled string patterns, it appears pattern P accepts strings where there is an opening '(' then closing ']' -- these two don't necessarily have to be adjacent, but they need to occur in that order. It doesn't matter how many '(' precede or how many ']' follow, so long as the string begins with '(' and ends with ']'. The string "(]" fits this pattern as it starts with an opening '(' and ends with a closing ']'.

Input: "(]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be strings that contain round brackets "(" and "]". Strings that don't have this pattern or have any other characters do not fit the pattern P. The given string "(()[(()[])[]])[]" contains other characters "()[]", thus it does not fit the pattern P. 

Input: "(()[(()[])[]])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Based on the patterns provided, the pattern P seems to prioritize pairs of parentheses "()" and brackets "[]" not being adjacent to each other nor nested within one another. A valid string would be comprised of a sequence of opening brackets "(" or "[" followed by a sequence of closing brackets ")" or "]" with no brackets of the opposite type in between. As for the given string "[)", it features an opening bracket "[" immediately followed by a closing parenthesis ")" without the proper sequential requirement being satisfied. Therefore, this string does not fit pattern P.

Input: "[)" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be strings composed of "(" followed by "]" repeated in some order or iteration, but brackets ("[]") or parentheses ("()") pairs, or any mixture of them, are not present or applicable in pattern P. The string given, "[[))", contains only brackets, and uses "]" but not "(". For these reasons, this string does not fit the pattern P.

Input: "[[))" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P, as far as the given examples show, seems to only match strings that start with a left parenthesis '(' and end with a right bracket ']', and do not contain any pair of matching parentheses or brackets. The input string "[[))" starts with a left bracket '[' and ends with a right parenthesis ')', and thus does not fit the pattern. Furthermore, it has matching brackets, which is not seen in any of the True examples.

Input: "[[))" Label: False
EXPLN: From the given pattern examples, pattern P seems to consist solely of "(" and "[", then followed by "]" and ")". The number or order of these parentheses or brackets does not matter, but "(" and "[" always come first and "]" and ")" always come second. This means that,  once a "]" or ")" appears in the sequence, no more "(" or "[" can follow it. The string "[)[[[)))" does not follow this pattern because after the "]" closes, "(" opens again, which is not found in the pattern. 

Input: "[)[[[)))" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P appears to be one where each left parenthesis "(" is followed by a closing bracket "]", there are no square brackets "[" involved in pattern P and round brackets ")" are not included as well. Therefore, a string satisfies pattern P if and only if it consists of a sequence of "(" followed by a sequence of "]" with the same length or more. The input string "[)" does not satisfy pattern P because it contains a square bracket "[" and also the left parenthesis "(" is not followed by a closing bracket "]". 

Input: "[)" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to match strings that begin with an open parenthesis "(" and end with a closed bracket "]", whereas strings that contain the correct pairs of parentheses "()" or brackets "[]" do not fit pattern P. By this pattern, the given string "(]" fits as it starts with "(" and ends with "]". Because of this, the string should be labeled True.

Input: "(]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be strings that start with an opening parenthesis "(," and end with a closing bracket "]," where the complete string doesn't form a correct sequence of balanced parentheses and brackets. The string "()[()[]]" starts with an opening parenthesis and ends with a closing bracket, but it does form a correct sequence of balanced parentheses and brackets - all open brackets/parentheses have corresponding close brackets/parentheses in the right order - and so does not fit pattern P. 

Input: "()[()[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P is comprised of strings where parentheses always precede square brackets. The open and close sequences don't matter as the pattern appears to allow both '([' and '(]', and similarly, '])' and '[)'. However, no string fitting pattern P contains square brackets preceding parentheses or has separate sequences of parentheses and square brackets. Looking at the unknown string, "()[(()[])[]]", it does not fit pattern P. While it does begin with a parenthesis, the parenthesis is immediately followed by a closing parenthesis and square brackets are not immediately following the opening parenthesis. Further, it contains mixed and separate sequences of parentheses and square brackets.

Given the string with appropriate label:

Input: "()[(()[])[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be any string that consists of only "(", ")", "[", "]" but without proper pairing and opening-closing sequences. In pattern P, brackets and parentheses need not match or be ordered correctly. This is evident from the given examples where strings like "((]]" and "(]" are marked as True despite improper pairing and ordering of the parentheses and brackets. On the other hand, any string that has properly paired and ordered brackets and parentheses are marked as False, such as "()", "(()[])[(()[])[]]". The given string "[)" also follows mismatched brackets and parenthesis, hence this would fit pattern P. 

Input: "[)" Label: True
EXPLN: From the sample strings provided, pattern P entails a string of odd length where "(" and "]" belong to pattern P while "[" and ")" do not. The string provided, "[[[[[))))[))" does not fit pattern P as it adheres to the characters "[" and ")" which do not belong to pattern P and its length is not odd.

Input: "[[[[[))))[))" Label: False
EXPLN: Based on the observation of given examples, pattern P accepts strings which only consists of opening round brackets '(' and closing square brackets ']' in any order and any number, and rejects any other kinds of brackets. The string "[[))" has closing round brackets ')' and opening square brackets '[', which do not fit into pattern P. Hence, this string does not fit pattern P.

Input: "[[))" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P is a string made up only of open parentheses "(" and closed brackets "]". If there are any other types of parentheses or brackets, i.e., open brackets "[" or closed parenthesis ")", it does not match the pattern P. The string provided, "[[))", includes other types of brackets and parentheses and hence, does not fit pattern P.

Input: "[[))" Label: False
EXPLN: Based on the examples, pattern P seems to be a string where the parentheses '(' are always closed by ']' instead of the regular ')', and brackets are not allowed to appear in the string. This string "()[()[(()[])[]]]" contains right parenthesis ')' closing a left parenthesis '(', and also contains brackets '[]' so it does not fit the defined pattern P.

Input: "()[()[(()[])[]]]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P appears to require an open parenthesis "(", followed by any number of other open or closing parentheses "(" or ")", and it all must end with a series of closing brackets "]". Notably, square brackets should only appear at the end, if present. The sequence "((((]]]]" follows these constraints, with a series of opening parentheses at the beginning and concluding with closing square brackets.

Input: "((((]]]]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P appears to be that every pair of parenthesis must start with "(" and end with "]" as opposed to each other pair with usual "()" or "[]". The string provided does not fit this pattern as it contains a pair of parenthesis as "[[)" which is not the characteristic of the pattern.

Input: "[[[[)))[[[))[)))" Label: False
EXPLN: Based on the given examples, pattern P seems to be any string that contains only uninterrupted open parentheses "(" followed by uninterrupted close brackets "]". The string "[[[[))))" doesn't follow this pattern because it starts with a bracket and ends with a parenthesis. 

Input: "[[[[))))" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be satisfied by strings which start with an open parenthesis "(" and end with a closed bracket "]". Further, they do not seem to contain the pair of "[" or "]", or the pair of "(" or ")". Any string that contains these pairs, or does not satisfy the open "(" and close "]" pattern, is labeled False. 

The given string is "(()[])[]". This string contains multiple instances of paired parentheses "(" and ")". It also does not start with "(" and end with "]". Considering these conditions, it does not fit into pattern P.

Input: "(()[])[]" Label: False
EXPLN: From the examples provided, pattern P seems to be any string consisting of open parentheses first, followed by any number of close brackets. A string fitting pattern P doesn't need to be properly balanced nor does it need any brackets or parentheses to be paired or matching. The string "(((]]](((]]]" follows this pattern, since it starts with open parentheses and ends with close brackets, all distributed without any particular balance.

Input: "(((]]](((]]]" Label: True
EXPLN: Looking at the examples, pattern P appears to be satisfied in cases where it seems to prioritize '(' followed by a ']'. '(' appears to be open for all instances, whereas '[' only seems to open when followed by ')'. The input string '[)' does not match this pattern thus it does not fit pattern P.

Input: "[)" Label: False
EXPLN: From observing the given strings we can see that pattern P is defined as a sequence of parentheses and/or brackets where every opening bracket (whether round or square) is immediately followed by a closing round bracket and every opening parenthesis is immediately followed by a closing square bracket. Any other order or arrangement of parentheses and brackets does not match pattern P. Turning to the unlabeled string, it does not fit this pattern as it consists of brackets and parentheses closing on each other i.e. "()[]". Based on this, I would label the string as False.

Input: "(()[()[]])[]" Label: False.
EXPLN: From the given true examples, it seems that pattern P involves having open parentheses "(" followed by closing square brackets "]", regardless of how many of each there are, and in any order (as long as the parentheses are before the brackets). The string "(()[])[()[]]" does not follow this pattern, as it includes a mixture of both parentheses and brackets, with closing parentheses ")" and opening brackets "[", which is not observed in pattern P.

Input: "(()[])[()[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be matching strings that only have opening parentheses "(" and closing brackets "]". It does not match any string that contains either closing parentheses ")" or opening bracket "[". Therefore, the input string "((]]" fits the pattern P because it only contains opening parentheses and closing brackets.

Input: "((]]" Label: True
EXPLN: 

Based on the given examples, it seems that pattern P can be defined as a sequence of parentheses and brackets where every open bracket "(" is immediately followed by a closing square bracket "]" and every open square bracket "[" does not appear at all. No patterns of "[", "]", "()" were allowed, as well as nested sequences of parentheses or brackets. Examples that contained these elements were labeled False. 

As per the pattern P, the Input: "(((((]]]]((]]]" should be labeled True since it follows the pattern with all instances of "(" immediately followed by "]" and no instances of "[" or nested "()" or "[]". 

Therefore, 

Input: "(((((]]]]((]]]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P appears to recognize strings that consist of an equal or larger number of opening and closing parenthesis pairs () and bracket pairs [], with the condition that the closing brackets ] should always precede the opening brackets [ (if any), and the closing parenthesis ) should always precede the opening parenthesis (. Thus, in pattern P, the strings always start with '(', and ')', '[' or ']' are not allowed. From the given examples, all strings that have the opposite order (starting with '[', ')', or strings having '(', ')', '[', or ']' in the order of opening parentheses or brackets followed by the closing ones) are labeled as False.

The given string "()[]" starts with an opening parenthesis '(', followed by a closing parenthesis ')', then an opening bracket '[', and a closing bracket ']'. This order is against pattern P. 

Therefore, the input: "()[]" should be labeled as False. 

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: The given pattern P considers a string to be True if it only contains round brackets or parentheses "()[]" where the opening bracket does not match with its equivalent closing bracket. In other words, an opening curved bracket "(" doesn't close with ")" but it is followed by a closing square bracket "]", likewise, an opening square bracket "[" doesn't close with "]" but it is followed by a closing curved bracket ")". Furthermore, the strings that contain strictly matching opening and closing parentheses like "()", "[]" or any combinations thereof are marked as False. 

Given these observations, the string "(()[])[(()[])[]]" contains sets of matching parentheses which contradicts the pattern P. Therefore, it should be labeled as False.

Input: "(()[])[(()[])[]]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P consists of strings where a parenthesis "(" is always followed by "]" regardless of the number, and a bracket "]" is always preceded by "(" with any number. The string does not contain any "[" or ")" characters. The given string "()[[]" does not follow this pattern as we have ")" and "[" characters present and also "()" and "[]" sequences which do not fit pattern P.

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be a string that starts with an open parenthesis '(' followed by any number of other parentheses or brackets, ending with a close bracket ']'. It does not matter whether the parentheses and brackets are properly paired and nested according to traditional rules of syntax as they would be in formal math or programming languages. The string given as input "(]" fits this pattern because it starts with '(' and ends with ']'. 

Given this understanding of pattern P, the properly labeled string is:

Input: "(]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P appears to be strings where there are more closing brackets and parentheses ("]" and ")") than opening brackets and parentheses ("[" and "("), and final characters are closing brackets ("]"). In the unmarked string "[[[[))))", this pattern does not hold, as there are more opening brackets than closing ones and the final character is a closing parenthesis, not a bracket.

Input: "[[[[))))" Label: False
EXPLN: The given pattern P seems to be strings that have only parentheses "(" at the beginning and only brackets "]" at the end. There's no specific number of parentheses or brackets, and in some cases, they may be mixed, but the rule is that you start with parentheses and end with brackets without any brackets appearing before all parentheses are placed and without any parentheses appearing after the brackets start. The string "(]" fits this pattern as it starts with parenthesis and ends with bracket without mixing the order.

Input: "(]" Label: True
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to be a sequence of parentheses and brackets where every opening "(" is followed by a "]", regardless of the count. Here, the string "()[]" does not follow this pattern. Inside the string, the "(" is followed by ")" and "[" is followed by "]", not fitting the pattern P requirements.

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P includes strings where there are either only parentheses open ("(") followed by brackets close ("]") or a pair of parentheses open and closed ("(]") together. Brackets open ("[") or parentheses close (")") are not included in pattern P. The string in question, "()[]" contains a closing parenthesis (")") and an opening bracket ("["), thus it does not fit pattern P.

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Pattern P seems to involve strings that only consist of parentheses and brackets, where each opening parenthesis "(" is immediately followed by a closing bracket "]", and any other parentheses or brackets are ignored. So, in these strings, the number and grouping of other parentheses and brackets do not matter. Based on this pattern, the string "(((]]]" fits pattern P because it contains at least one occurrence of "(" immediately followed by "]". 

Input: "(((]]]" Label: True
EXPLN: Based on the examples given, pattern P matches strings that only contain open parentheses "(" and closed brackets "]", in any order and any repetition. It clearly does not include closed parentheses ")" or open brackets "[", since every example inclusive of these characters is labelled False. 

The given string is "()[]". It contains closed parentheses ")" and open brackets "[", which are not included in pattern P. 

Therefore, the provided string does not fit pattern P. 

Input: "()[]" Label: False
EXPLN: Based on my analysis of the given strings, it appears pattern P requires that each string start with an opening parenthesis "(" and not include any properly matched pairs of brackets or parentheses. The strings that are marked as True are all starting with "(" and are not comprising of any efficiently paired brackets or parentheses. In other words, they are not balanced in terms of opening and closing symbols. In contrast, all the strings marked as False possess at least one instance of properly matched pairs and hence considered as balanced strings. The string in question, "[[[[))))", starts with the bracket "[" and not with the parenthesis "(" and it does not include any properly paired brackets or parentheses, however, the starting symbol is wrong according to the pattern definition and hence it does not qualify for pattern P. 

Input: "[[[[))))" Label: False
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be that the string of parentheses and brackets must start with an opening parenthesis "(", end with a closing bracket "]", and should not contain any correct pair of parentheses or brackets. That is, "()" and "[]" must not appear in the string. If we look at the unlabelled string "(]", it starts with "(" and ends with "]" and does not contain any valid pair. Therefore, the string fits the pattern P.

Input: "(]" Label: True
EXPLN: The pattern P seems to be characterized by strings which start with a set of parentheses with '(' first and ']' later, but not vice versa. It does not permit '[' or ')' characters at all. The order doesn't matter so long as these rules are followed. Thus, the string "(((((]]]]]" fits this pattern because it begins with '(' characters followed by ']' characters, implying that it belongs to pattern P.

Input: "(((((]]]]]" Label: True
